This project demonstrates how to use the FastLED library to create dynamic and colorful lighting effects with addressable LEDs. I can customize the colors, gradients, and timing of the lighting effects to suit my needs or preferences.

It involves controlling a strip of addressable LEDs using the FastLED library in an Arduino-based environment.

Material List Provided By School
Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano, etc.)
R
Addressable LED strip (e.g., WS2812B, SK6812, etc.)
Jumper wires of connecting the Arduino board to the LED strip
Power supply (e.g., USB cable, battery pack, etc.) to power the Arduino board and the LED strip
Mac laptop was used during the process with the Arduino IDE installed to upload the code to the Arduino board.
